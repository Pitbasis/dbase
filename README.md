# dbbasis
A lightweight FreeBSD/Linux tool for creating, managing, and having full control over databases via the command line.

This is a lightweight tool I built for creating, managing, and having full control over databases directly from the terminal. I originally developed it for FreeBSD, but it works just as well on Linux systems. The main goal was to have a fast, zero-dependency utility that gives you total control over database structures without needing a heavy engine running in the background.

It includes a self-installation routine that automatically moves the script to /usr/local/bin, so once you've set the execution permissions with chmod +x dbbasis.sh, you can just run dbbasis as a global command from anywhere in your system. It’s designed to be simple, fast, and stay out of your way while you work.
